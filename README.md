# plant_app_version1

Just worked on:

Getting the to-do page to scroll between watering and other tasks.
Made a very basic swipe with no animation, look into making this look nicer. 

To-do: 

Make new plant page 
Add other tasks other than watering 
Sort dates out so it doesn't always just take todays at start up 
Add a rooms page
